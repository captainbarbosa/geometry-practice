# Geometry.py    

A test script that creates three geographic points on an XY plane.    
Points are assigned unique IDs, tests for coordinate/unique ID equality and calculates distance between points.    

######Note: This script is intended for my own practice only. There are no inputs, but feel free to run this and see what it looks like.
